# Gentetic-Algorithms
An assignment training the model using genetic algorithms on the unseen dataset and trying to bring down the validation error
close to the training error and presenting with the best vectors which might perform well on the unseen dataset

- ouput.json is an 2D array of the 10 best vectors we think would perform on unseen dataset trained using the given algorithm
- generations has the previous generations for each of the vectors in output.json
- report.pdf is the summary and analysis of our genetic algorithm
